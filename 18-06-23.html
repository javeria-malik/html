           <h1>cloud computing</h1>
            Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet.
                 Instead of relying on local servers or personal computers, cloud computing allows users to access and use computing resources, such as storage, processing power, and
                 software applications, from remote servers hosted by cloud service providers.</p>

            <h1>metaverse</h1>
            The term "metaverse" refers to a virtual reality space where users can interact with a 
                computer-generated environment and other users in real-time. It is often described as a collective 
                virtual shared space that encompasses the virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet.</p>
